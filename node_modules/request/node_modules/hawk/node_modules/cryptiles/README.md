## Methods

### `randomString(<Number> size)`
Returns a cryptographically strong pseudo-random data string. Takes a size argument for the length of the string.

### `fixedTimeComparison(<String> a, <String> b)`
Compare two strings using fixed time algorithm (to prevent time-based analysis of MAC digest match). Returns `true` if the strings match, `false` if they differ.
